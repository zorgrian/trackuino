# Introduction #
We will review the different types of antenna designs used with the Trackuino as well as their performance. Just a few will be:

  * Dipole
  * Quarter Wave Ground Plane
  * Half Wave Ground Plane
  * J-Pole

## Dipole ##

## A quarter wave ground plane antenna from scavenged parts (SO-239 connector) ##

This antenna is really easy to build. You only need a SO-239 chassis connector. The radials and radiator can be piano wire or just coat hangers straightened up. Check out this [blog entry](http://trackuino.blogspot.com/2010/04/trash-digging-at-its-finest-111-swr-vhf.html) for construction details.

As simple as it looks, this antenna might not be the most adequate for a balloon flight. The radials add up to the moment of inertia, making the antenna oppose quite strongly to the spinning of the payload. This can cause wear on the connectors and break them. The other achilles heel of this antenna is the connection between the radiator and the center pin of the SO-239 connector. It can be reinforced by wrapping it in brass tube, but remember this needs to survive a crash from 100,000 ft.

## Quarter wave ground plane (SMA connector) ##

This is my variation on the previous design. It is constructed from a SMA connector with 1/16" square brass tubing soldered to the center terminal and radiation from the sides. Then the tubing is bent at 30-40 degrees and thin music wire is inserted and soldered into the holes. The whole design weighs 14-16 grams depending on the amount of solder and wire used. It is quite light and durable.

_**UPDATE: This design was able to transmit from Los Angeles to Phoenix using a 300mW transmitter. It also survived an ascent and decent from 60,500 ft at 1600 ft/sec without damage.**_

## Half wave ground plane ##

A half wave ground plane is not as desirable for HAB applications because it has more gain in a horizontal direction. The quarter plane by contrast has most of its gain in a 45 degree cone. This allows the quarter wave antenna to focus more of the available power to the ground below it and not off into space.

## J-pole ##
