There are several sites offering on-line predictions based on past winds data:

  * [Balloon trajectory forecasts](http://weather.uwyo.edu/polar/balloon_traj.html), at the University of Wyoming.
  * [Landing predictor](http://habhub.org/predict/), at the University of Cambridge
  * [On-Line Near Space Flight Track Prediction Utility](http://nearspaceventures.com/w3Baltrak/readyget.pl), by the Near Space Ventures team.

This is an example of how the Balloon trajectory forecast, at the University of Wyoming, works. Basically you just enter the launch coordinates and the expected burst altitude:

Then, click submit and you'll get a summary like this. Based on the prediction I just run, the balloon is expected to land 10.6 nautical miles, 48ยบ from the launch point:

If you scroll down, you can see the expected behavior of the balloon at different altitudes:
