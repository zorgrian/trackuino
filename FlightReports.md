Brad reported:

```
Payload was recovered this morning using the last two packets received
by one of the tracking teams (we were able to drive within 1/3 mile of the 
last reported position at 2,772 ft).  We were on a ridge at about 1,600 ft.

The recovery drive was amazing, as you can see the flight literally crossed
over the top of Mt. Hood, and thanks to the wonderful weather it made for
a fantastic afternoon.
