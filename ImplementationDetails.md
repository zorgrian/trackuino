# Introduction #

Output is 5v peak-to-peak, continuous-phase AFSK signal. Signal is pulse-width modulated at 62.5 KHz, so in most cases a low pass filter is not necessary. Only peak-to-peak voltage conditioning is required to suit the transmitter requirements, which can be done easily with a resistors divider. PTT is controlled by one of Arduino's digital outputs. Depending on the logic of the transmitter, a FET or BJT switch may be required. The tracker has been tested with a Radiometrix HX1 module, an SRB MX146 and an ICOM 229H radio.
