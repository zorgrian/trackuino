SMA (Sub-Miniature version A) connectors are coaxial RF connectors with a screw type coupling mechanism, 50 Î© impedance and they are designed for use from DC to 18 GHz.

There are two kinds of connectors: SMA and RPSMA, the latter is commonly found in consumer equipment like Wifi antennas. There is some confusion when it comes to SMA male/female nomenclature because RPSMA uses the counter-intuitive convention of male=receptacle and female=pin. SMA uses the right logic, though.

To further confuse you, some manufacturers refer to the male SMA as plug, and to the female SMA as jack, and the same convention applies to RPSMA.
